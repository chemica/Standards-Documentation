# Information Security

We follow [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page) standards for information security in all our work, alongside client side Digital Standards.

Project definitions MUST include a data catalogue and risk assessment and be clearly identified in any technical documentation.

Pen testing of any FullSIX hosted system SHOULD be built into the project lifecycle, particularly in the case of any product carrying a data risk.  The QA process in these instances should test against the OWASP top ten where appropriate.
